For example, it may feel boring to pick up toys after having fun or ending a big task. \n\n✨ When you see Your Child is about to start an unwanted behaviour, distract them by asking them to do something else, before the unwanted behaviour begins or gets worse. \n\n✨Invite Your Child in a chore you are doing.
